            <b>Dan Donnan</b> quit his job in 2022 to spend his time making video games. Some of these
            games can be found on the <a href="index.html" target="_blank">main page</a>.
            <br><br>
            After achieving a First class degree in Computer & Video Games in 2013, Donnan spent 5
            years working on <div class="internalLink" onclick="ShowPopup('lego')">over a dozen LEGO titles</div>
            at <b>TT Games</b>. Between 2013 and 2014 he tested handheld
            and mobile games, before joining the console team at the end of 2014 as a Junior Game Scripter.
            In 2018, and now a Senior Game Scripter, Donnan left the games industry.
            <br><br>
            The next 3 and a half years were spent as a Software Developer for <b>Citrus Lime</b>. This
            included refactoring the codebase to properly modernise and scale their POS system, as
            well as adding in new features from database right through to the front-end.
            <br><br>
            Now Donnan develops games with MonoGame and Unity in his preferred language of C#, and
            occassionally has to dabble in the nightmares that are JavaScript and CSS for things like
            this very website.
